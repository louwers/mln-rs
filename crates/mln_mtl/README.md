Ports the C++ Metal backend (`src/mln/mtl`, its shaders and the headless
backend) onto Metal through `objc2-metal`. It renders on Apple platforms only,
and is empty elsewhere.

Part of [mln-rs](https://github.com/louwers/mln-rs), a Rust port of the
[MapLibre Native](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native) map rendering
core. All its crates are released together, at the same version.
